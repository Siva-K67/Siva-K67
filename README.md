### 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m currently pursuing **M.Tech at IIIT Bangalore**, with a strong interest in building scalable, intelligent, and real-world tech solutions.  
I enjoy solving problems using full-stack development, LLMs, and real-time data analytics.

---

### 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** C++, JavaScript, Python  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB  
- **Currently Learning:** MERN Stack, Socket.IO, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### 📚 Ongoing Projects

<details>
<summary><strong>💬 MERN Chat App (with new features)</strong></summary>

- **🔴 RED Notifications:**  
  Messages marked as urgent by the sender appear in **red** until opened, making them stand out from regular chats.

- **🧠 Group Chat Summarizer (LLM-powered):**  
  Uses a free LLM (e.g., **Mixtral via OpenRouter**) to summarize large group conversations.  
  Helps users decide if they should read the full chat or just the specific sections or skip the whole chat altogether.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🤖 Chatbot for Customers (LLM Integrated)</strong></summary>

- A lightweight customer support chatbot powered by a free LLM like **Mixtral**.  
- Capable of answering common queries and guiding users through basic support flow.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📈 Stock Market Predictor</strong></summary>

- LSTM-based model to forecast stock trends from historical time series data.  
- Implemented in Python using real datasets for training and validation.

### 📖 Publications & Research

- 📝 **Research Paper (In Progress):**  
  *“Real-Time IoT-Based Compost Monitoring System with Data Analytics”* — part of my M.Tech course work at IIIT Bangalore.  
  The paper explores anomaly detection in compost formation using data from sensors and employing data analysis methods on them.

- 🤖 **RAG-based Compost QA System:**  
  As part of the same research paper, I developed a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (RAG) prototype.  
  It helps users interact with compost system data using natural language questions answered by an LLM.  It can answer user questions about compost behavior using sensor logs and an LLM.  
  For example: *"Why is the temperature unstable at night?"*
