### 🧑‍🎓 About Me

I’m currently pursuing **M.Tech at IIIT Bangalore**, with a strong interest in building scalable, intelligent, and real-world tech solutions.  
I enjoy solving problems using full-stack development, LLMs, and real-time data analytics.

### 🧰 Tech Stack

- 💻 **Languages:** C++, JavaScript, Python  
- ⚙️ **Frameworks & Libraries:** React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB  
- 📚 **Currently Learning:** MERN Stack, Socket.IO, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### 🛠️ Ongoing Projects

<details>
<summary><strong>💬New Features MERN Chat App</strong></summary>

- 🔴 **RED Notifications:**  
  Messages marked as urgent by the sender appear in **red** until opened, making them stand out from regular chats.

- 🧠 **Group Chat Summarizer (LLM-powered):**  
  Uses a free LLM (e.g., **GeminiAI API**) to summarize large group conversations.  
  Helps users decide if they should read the full chat or just the specific sections or skip the whole chat altogether.

- 🕵️ **Decoy Chat Feature:**
  When a chat is opened, a fake but believable conversation is displayed by default.
  Entering a secret keyword instantly switches to the real conversation.
  Closing the chat resets it back to the fake version for privacy protection.

<details>
<summary><strong>🤖 RAG Based Chatbot for Customers (LLM Integrated)</strong></summary>

- A lightweight customer support chatbot powered by a free LLM like **Mixtral**.  
- Capable of answering common queries and guiding users through basic support flow.

<summary><strong>📈 Stock Market Predictor</strong></summary>

- LSTM-based model to forecast stock trends from historical time series data.  
- Implemented in Python using real datasets for training and validation.

### 📄 Publications & Research

- 📝 **Research Paper (Under Review):**  
  *“Real-Time IoT-Based Compost Monitoring System with Data Analytics”* — part of my M.Tech research at IIIT Bangalore.  
  The paper explores anomaly detection in compost formation using data from sensors and employing data analysis methods on them.

- 🤖 **RAG-based Compost QA System:**  
  As part of the same research paper, I developed a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (RAG) prototype.  
  It helps users interact with compost system data using natural language questions answered by an LLM.  
  For example: *"Why is the temperature unstable at night?"*
